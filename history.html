<h1>Origin of Moon</h1>
<body style="background-image: url('https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/photo/default/nasa-galaxy_9pu4.jpg');">
    <P>The leading theory of the Moon’s origin is that a Mars-sized
       body collided with Earth approximately 4.5 billion 
       years ago, and the resulting debris from both Earth and 
       the impactor accumulated to form our natural satellite. 
    </P>
    <P>The newly formed Moon was in a molten state. 
        Within about 100 million years, most of the global “magma ocean” 
        had crystallized, with less-dense rocks floating upward and eventually forming the lunar crust.
