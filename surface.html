    <p>Children's fairytales tell us that the moon is made of cheese,
         but like all bodies in the solar system, rock is the more realistic ingredient.
         The moon's surface is covered with dead volcanoes, 
         impact craters, and lava flows, some visible to the unaided stargazer.
    </p>
    <p>Early scientists thought the dark stretches of the moon might be oceans,
         and so named such features mare, which is Latin for "seas"
        They are oceans of a sort, but rather than water, such bodies are made up of pools of hardened lava.
           Early in the moon's history, the interior was molten enough to produce volcanoes, 
           though it quickly cooled and hardened. 
           Lava also burst from the crust when large enough asteroids broke through the surface.
