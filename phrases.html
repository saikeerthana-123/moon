    <p>We have a slightly different view of the Moon each night.</p> 
    <p>We describe how the Moon looks with the eight Moon phases, or shapes:</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ‘ New: We cannot see the Moon when it is a new moon.</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ’ Waxing Crescent: We see the waxing crescent phase as a thin crescent opening to the left.</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ“ First Quarter: We see the first quarter phase as a half moon.</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ” Waxing Gibbous:The waxing gibbous phase is between a half moon and full moon. Waxing means it is getting bigger. </p>
        <p>ðŸŒ• Full: We can see the Moon completely illuminated during full moons.</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ– Waning Gibbous: The waning gibbous phase is between a half moon and full moon. Waning means it is getting smaller.</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ— Third Quarter: We see the third quarter moon as a half moon, too. It is the opposite half as illuminated in the first quarter moon.</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ˜ Waning Crescent: We see the waning crescent phase as a thin crescent opening to the right.</p>
